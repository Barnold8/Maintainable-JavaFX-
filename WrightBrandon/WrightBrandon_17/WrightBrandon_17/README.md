# Description
In this you speed, up slown down, eat fruit, eat powerups, avoid enemies and avoid  trees! This game allows you to pick a theme and the colour of the snakes head to show off your uniqueness during gameplay and then you can submit your score to keep your name in the spotlight permanently.

# How to install
To install, run mvn clean javafx:run. The game should launch automatically! :)
NOTE: This build does not run on UNIX systems, this is due to file pathing 
issues. You will have to run this on a windows machine.

### Information

#### Fruit
Fruit provide new body parts for the snake! They add 1 to the score. Make sure you pick these up! If the "Dasher" mode is set, the fruit will also speed the snake up.

### Trees
Trees provide an obstacle for the game, providing fresh new levels for the player to enjoy and provide a challenge. Be careful, they'll make you game over!

### Enemy
When it collides its x and y speeds are inverted making this dog a pest but a fair challenge to learn. 

### Power Ups
There are three power ups in this game. The yellow, this decreases the player speed. The red one, this increases the player speed. And finally, this one can set a random speed to the player(50% chance), teleport them(20% chance) or even add 64 pieces to the snake(10% chance).
